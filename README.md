# Mining-Injury-Source-Classification-Machine-Learning-Model
Project Overview:
The Mining Risk Classifier project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost classifier, to predict and classify mining-related risks. The project aims to enhance safety measures and operational efficiency within mining operations. The dataset provided by Aurum Mining Corporation, containing 49 columns and 36,000 rows of features like location, occupation, and degree of injury, serves as the foundation for this predictive risk assessment system.

Key Features:

Advanced Machine Learning: Leveraging the power of XGBoost, a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, to develop a robust risk classifier.

Data Preprocessing: Employing comprehensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization techniques to ensure data quality and consistency.

Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant attributes through Pearson correlation, mutual information gain, and expert-driven feature engineering.

Imbalanced Data Handling: Mitigating class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE and ADASYN to prevent bias in the risk classification model.

Model Evaluation: Rigorous model evaluation using diverse metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure accurate risk prediction.

Interpretability: Providing insights into model decisions through SHAP values and feature importance plots for transparency and understanding.

Real-time Deployment: Integrating the risk classifier into operational systems to enable real-time risk assessment and proactive decision-making.
